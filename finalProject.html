            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                Cybercrime Profiling is crucial for understanding and combating always
                evolving cyber threats, yet current cyber methodologies face challenges
                in standardisation, resource demands, adaptation to modern cyber crime.
                This research study investigates the strengths and limitations of current
                profiling frameworks through scoping literature review and analysis of
                real-world cyber crime trends. Key findings reveal the lack of empirical
                validation, struggle with data quality dependencies, have separate tax-
                onomies making collaboration difficult. The increasing number of social
                engineering attacks like phishing and vishing highlights the need for more
                flexible profiling methods.<br>
                Inspired by already existing methodology and building onto it, this
                study proposes a framework addressing the limitations by including a ded-
                icated Social Engineering Analysis section, motivation-centric behaviour
                taxonomy and standardised modular reporting. This proposed framework
                was tested against a vishing attack, demonstrating, how the framework
                is able to map out the attackers motives and technical indicators using
                MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques. Results highlight the frame-
                workâ€™s structured abilities to collect evidence, use deductive and inductive
                profiling.<br>
                In order to combat modern cyber crime, this study highlights how vital
                standardised profiling methodologies and empirical validation is. Future
                research should prioritise implementing a larger scale of empirical valida-
                tion and take advantage of AI-driven tools widely available for pattern
                recognition. This project aligns with the following CyBok Skill: Adver-
                sarial Behaviours.<br>
                Keywords: Cyber Profiling, Cyber Crime, Social Engineering Analysis,
                Framework Adaptation, Threat Intelligence.
