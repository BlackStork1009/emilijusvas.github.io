            <h2>Fishing</h2>
            <p>
                In my free time I like to fish. I feel like fishing allows you to spend time with yourself in the nature where you don't 
                have to worry about any problems. The whole process of fishing is very soothing and relaxing, even though you do not 
                catch any fish. The picture contains the tench I caught in the summer of 2024. My friends and I found a great, secluded 
                spot for tench fishing, making 2024 a great year for fishing.

            <h2>Graduation</h2>
            <p>
                I started University in 2022 and graduated in 2025. In those 3 years I've learnt quite a lot. Made new friends, challenged 
                myself and of course learn a lot. My time at university was a mix of challenges and growth, both inside and outside 
                the classroom. Moving into a new environment taught me how to be independent and manage my own time, while also giving 
                me the chance to meet people from all kinds of backgrounds. Some of the best memories were spending time with my friends. 
                Looking back, uni wasn’t just about the degree—it shaped my confidence, resilience, and the way I approach life today.

            <h2>Travelling</h2>
            <p>
                Travelling allows me to meet and embrace new cultures from all around the world. 
                When travelling I like to pay attention to the things that are regular for the people who live there, but not so regular 
                to the tourists. For example, walking around and looking at the buildings and their architecture, paying attention on how 
                locals communicate with eachtoher and obviously the food and sightseeing. I have visited 14 countries so far, there are 
                many more countries I would like to visit sometime soon. For the next trip I would like to go to the USA. However not New 
                York city, Los Angeles, Miami, etc, no. I'd like to go to a town with the population of about 20 thousand people and explore 
                the culture there.
